        "Founded in 2025, Prodigy Corp started with a focused mission: build and acquire profitable digital assets. We were product builders first, creating our own platforms and scaling them in competitive markets.",
        "But something unexpected happened. As we developed our portfolio, other entrepreneurs and businesses took notice. They wanted to know how we built products so efficiently and scaled them so quickly. Word spread, and soon we found ourselves fielding requests to build custom solutions for others.",
        "That's when we realized we had something special—a lean, technology-first approach that delivers results without the bloat of traditional agencies. We use the same AI-powered workflows and rapid development methods for client projects that we use for our own successful ventures.",
        "Today, we operate as both product builders and strategic partners. Our portfolio gives us real market insights, while our client work keeps us sharp and innovative. This dual perspective means we understand what actually works—not just what looks good in a presentation."
